# Blockchain-based Digital Transcript Wallet

## Description
The Blockchain-based Digital Transcript Wallet is a decentralized solution that allows users to securely store and retrieve their academic transcripts on the Aptos blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures that academic records remain tamper-proof, easily verifiable, and accessible only by the rightful owner.

## Vision of the Project
Our vision is to revolutionize the way academic transcripts are stored, shared, and verified. Traditional transcript management systems are prone to inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and delays. By introducing blockchain technology, we aim to provide students and institutions with a seamless, transparent, and immutable record-keeping system that eliminates fraud and enhances trust.

## Future Scope
- **Transcript Verification:** Institutions and employers can verify transcripts without intermediaries.
- **Multi-institution Support:** Support for multiple academic institutions to issue and manage transcripts.
- **Smart Contract Upgrades:** Enhancing contract functionalities to allow updates and permissions-based access.
- **Integration with Identity Systems:** Linking blockchain-based identity solutions for seamless authentication.
- **Mobile and Web Applications:** Providing easy access to transcript data through a user-friendly interface.
